      "question": "What is the outcome template introduced in Day 2 for structuring prompts?",
      "options": [
        "A) [Who] does [What] with [How] for [Why]",
        "B) [Task] in [Format] using [Tone] for [Audience]",
        "C) [Role] performs [Action] following [Rules] producing [Output]",
        "D) [Context] + [Instruction] + [Constraint] = [Result]"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The outcome template is [Task] in [Format] using [Tone] for [Audience]. Each slot removes a category of ambiguity: Task defines the action, Format defines the output structure, Tone defines the voice, and Audience defines who will consume the result.",

      "question": "A developer needs to write a commit message for a change that migrates user sessions from Redis to DynamoDB. Which prompt best applies the outcome template?",
      "options": [
        "A) Write a commit message for this change.",
        "B) Write a commit message in Conventional Commits format (type: subject + body) using a concise, technical tone for other contributors reading the git log. The change migrates user sessions from Redis to DynamoDB.",
        "C) Write a really good commit message that explains everything about the session migration.",
        "D) As a senior developer, write a commit message. Make it professional."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Option B correctly fills all four slots: Task (write a commit message), Format (Conventional Commits with type: subject + body), Tone (concise, technical), and Audience (other contributors reading the git log). It also provides the specific change context.",

      "options": [
        "A) Bullet-point summary",
        "B) FAQ format",

        "D) Code with inline comments"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "A deployment runbook for on-call engineers who may be unfamiliar with the service needs a sequential, step-by-step format with prerequisites listed upfront. This ensures engineers can follow the process reliably without prior knowledge. Bullet summaries lack sequence, FAQ format isn't procedural, and code comments don't cover operational steps.",

        "A) In API documentation for third-party developers",

        "C) In Architecture Decision Records that need to remain neutral",
        "D) In error log messages within application code"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "A persuasive tone is benefit-focused, concise, and action-oriented --- ideal for PR descriptions and proposals where you need to communicate the value of changes to reviewers. API docs should be technical, ADRs should be neutral, and error logs should be descriptive and factual.",

        "A) Speed, Quality, Cost, Scope",
        "B) Acceptable Content, Tone Requirements, Coding Standards, Output Limitations",

        "D) Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics, Style"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The four guideline categories are: Acceptable Content (what the AI should and should not produce), Tone Requirements (voice, formality, perspective), Coding Standards (language conventions, patterns, tooling preferences), and Output Limitations (length, scope, depth, what to omit).",

      "question": "A team notices that AI keeps suggesting class-based React components even though they exclusively use functional components. What is the correct response?",
      "options": [
        "A) Switch the team to class components since the AI prefers them",
        "B) Add 'Do not suggest class-based React components. We use functional components only.' to their guidelines under Acceptable Content",
        "C) Rewrite every individual prompt to mention functional components",
        "D) Stop using AI for React development"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The 'twice rule' applies: if you correct the AI for the same issue more than twice, it belongs in your guidelines, not in individual prompts. Adding an Acceptable Content guideline ensures this constraint applies to ALL future prompts automatically, without having to repeat it every time.",

        "A) Use TypeScript strict mode. No `any` types unless justified in a comment.",
        "B) Code review comments should be constructive and use 'we' language.",
        "C) Do not explain basic language syntax. Assume the reader is a mid-level developer.",
        "D) Never generate mock data that resembles real customer information."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Output Limitations control length, scope, depth, and what to omit. 'Do not explain basic language syntax' limits the depth and scope of the output. Option A is a Coding Standard, Option B is a Tone Requirement, and Option D is an Acceptable Content rule.",

        "A) Acceptable Content",
        "B) Tone Requirements",
        "C) Coding Standards",
        "D) Output Limitations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This is a Tone Requirement because it specifies the voice and format of written output (Conventional Commits format, imperative mood) and what the content should focus on (explaining 'why'). While it touches on format, the primary concern is how the message should read --- which falls under Tone.",
